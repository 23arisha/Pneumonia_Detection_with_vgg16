# Pneumonia Detection Using VGG16

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray images using a deep learning model based on the VGG16 architecture. The model is trained to classify X-ray images into two categories: pneumonia or normal. By leveraging transfer learning, the pre-trained VGG16 model is fine-tuned to achieve high accuracy on the dataset.

## Key Features

- **Data Augmentation**: Random transformations like resizing, rotation, horizontal flipping, and normalization are applied to the training data to improve generalization.
- **Transfer Learning**: A pre-trained VGG16 model is used as the base, with modifications to the final layers for pneumonia detection.
- **Early Stopping**: Training includes early stopping to prevent overfitting by monitoring validation loss.
- **Performance Metrics**: Validation loss and accuracy are monitored during training to evaluate model performance.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises X-ray images divided into three sets:
- **Training Set**: Used to train the model.
- **Validation Set**: Used to validate the model during training.
- **Test Set**: Used to evaluate the final performance of the model.

### Dataset Statistics
The images are analyzed for resolution and distribution across categories to ensure balanced representation.

## Model Architecture

- **Base Model**: VGG16 pre-trained on ImageNet.
- **Custom Classification Head**: 
  - Fully connected layers.
  - Dropout layers for regularization.
  - LogSoftmax activation for output probabilities.

## Training Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Images are preprocessed to match VGG16's input requirements (224x224 resolution, normalization using ImageNet standards).
   - Data augmentation is applied to the training set for enhanced robustness.

2. **Model Training**:
   - The early layers of VGG16 are frozen to retain learned features.
   - The fully connected layers are re-trained for pneumonia detection.
   - Cross-entropy loss is used as the criterion, and optimization is done using an Adam optimizer.

3. **Validation**:
   - Validation is conducted after each epoch to monitor performance.
   - Early stopping halts training when validation performance stops improving.

4. **Testing**:
   - The final model is evaluated on the test set for accuracy and loss.

## Results

- **Training and Validation**:
  - Achieved high training and validation accuracy with low validation loss.
  - Best validation accuracy: 93.75% at epoch 3.
  
- **Early Stopping**:
  - Training was stopped early after 8 epochs due to no significant improvement in validation loss.
